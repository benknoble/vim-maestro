# Vim talk

Given by me, D. Ben Knoble, circa summer 2018 for Nuage Networks and Nokia
interns who wanted to become vim maestros.

The presentation is written in markdown across a few files in `slides`, and
given using [sotte/presenting.vim](https://github.com/sotte/presenting.vim). You
might notice it's rather terse: I prefer my presentations to aid my memory, not
distract my audience.

Most of this talk was in fact interactive, with participants walking away with
their own vimrc (which we crafted by learning how to vim). If you have tmux and
presenting.vim installed, you can launch it with `./present.sh`.

Sample files for exercising are in `samples`.
